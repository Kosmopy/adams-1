# Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support

The master module Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support (ADAMS) is offered at the [Humboldt-University of Berlin](htpps://www.hu-berlin.de) 
by the [Chair of Information Systems](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi). 

ADAMS introduces students to recent developments in the scope of data-driven decision support. 
It focuses on deep learning and its applications in business and society. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of
textual data and other complex data such as sequences and images. 

Topics covered in the module include but are not limited to:

- Fundamentals of artificial neural networks
- Recurrent networks for sequential data processing with applications in finance
- A primer in generative models and adversarial learning
- Fundamentals of textual data analysis
- Neural network-based text embeddings: word2vec and cousins
- Convolutional neural networks for image analysis

The repository provides access to the Jupyter notebooks of the tutorial sessions and some Python scripts, which
were used to created to support the lecture.
